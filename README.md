Utility Library for working with [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).

## Data

Any JSON data is accepted, but given our domain, we will largely be working with xAPI Statements. 

The following partial Statement example is taken from:
`./resources/pathetic/data/long.json`

``` json
{
    "id": "6690e6c9-3ef0-4ed3-8b37-7f3964730bee",
    "actor": {...},
    "verb": {...},
    "object": {...},
    "result": {
        "success": true,
        "completion": true,
        ...
    },
    "context": {
        "contextActivities": {
            "category": [
                { "id": "http://www.example.com/meetings/categories/teammeeting",
                  ...}
            ],
            ...
        },
    },
    ...
}
```

Within this README, the above JSON xAPI Statement will be referred to as `stmt`

## Usage

The following API functions, with the exception of `path-spec/path->spec`, can be found in the `com.yetanalytics.pathetic` namespace. Each function takes an optional `opts-map` argument for optional arguments.

### parse-path

```
Parse a JSONPath string. Each parsed path is a vector with the
following entries:
    '..     recursive descent operator
    '*      wildcard operator
    [...]   a vector of strings (keys), integers (array indices), or
            maps (array slicing operations).
   
The following optional arguments are supported:
    :first?   Return the first path when multiple paths are joined
              using the \"|\" operator. Default false (in which case
              a vector of paths is returned).
    :strict?  If true, disallows recursive descent, array slicing,
              and negative indices. Conformant to the xAPI Profile
              spec and used by apply-values. Default false.
```

``` clojure
(parse-path stmt "$.context.contextActivities.grouping[*]")
=> [[["context"] ["contextActivities"] ["grouping"] '*]]

(parse-path stmt "$.id | $.timestamp")
=> [[["id"]] [["timestamp"]]]

(parse-path stmt "$.id | $.timestamp" :first? true)
=> [["id"]]
```

### get-paths

```
Given `json` and a JSONPath string `paths`, return a vector of
definite key paths. Each key path is a vector of strings (keys)
or integers (array indices); non-deterministic path entries like
recursive descent and wildcards are removed. If the string
contains multiple JSONPaths, we return the key paths for all
strings.
   
The following `opts-map` fields are supported:
    :return-missing?  Return paths that cannot match any location
                      in the JSON data as nil. Default false.
```

``` clojure

(get-paths stmt "$.context.contextActivities.category[*].id")
=> [["context" "contextActivities" "category" 0 "id"]]

(get-paths stmt "$.context.contextActivities.grouping[*]")
=> []

(get-paths stmt "$.context.contextActivities.grouping[*]" :return-missing? true)
=> [["context" "contextActivities" "grouping"]]
```

### get-values

```
Given `json` and a JSONPath string `paths`, return a vector of
JSON values. If the string contains multiple JSONPaths, we return
the union of all these values.
   
The following `opts-map` fields are supported:
    :return-missing?     Return values that cannot be found in the
                         JSON data as nil. Default false.
    :return-duplicates?  Return duplicate values in the array. Default
                         true.
```

``` clojure
(get-values stmt "$.id")
=> ["6690e6c9-3ef0-4ed3-8b37-7f3964730bee"]

(get-values stmt "$.result.score")
=> []

(get-values stmt "$.result.score" :return-missing? true)
=> [nil]

(get-values stmt "$.result['success','completion']")
=> [true true]

(get-values stmt "$.result['success','completion']" :return-duplicates? false)
=> [true]
```

### get-path-value-map

```
Given `json` and a JSONPath string `paths`, return a map associating
JSON paths to JSON values. Does not return duplicates.

The following `opts-map` arguments are supported:
    :return-missing?  Return path-value pairs where the path cannot
                      match any location in the JSON data. The object
                      is returned as nil. Default false.
```

```clojure
(get-path-value-map stmt "$.context.contextActivities.category[*].id")
=> {["context" "contextActivities" "category" 0 "id"]
    "http://www.example.com/meetings/categories/teammeeting"}
```

### select-keys-at

```
Given `json` and a JSONPath string `paths`, return a vector of maps
that represent the key path into the JSON value. If the string
contains multiple JSONPaths, we return the maps for all strings.
If no value exists at the selection, return a truncated map with
"{}" as the innermost possible value.
   
The following `opts-map` arguments are supported:
    :first?  Returns the maps corresponding to the first path (if
             paths are separated by \"|\"). Default false.
```

``` clojure
(select-keys-at stmt "$.id")
=> {"id" "6690e6c9-3ef0-4ed3-8b37-7f3964730bee"}

(select-keys-at stmt "$.context.contextActivities.category[*].id")
=> {"context"
    {"contextActivities"
     {"category"
      [{"id" "http://www.example.com/meetings/categories/teammeeting"}]}}}
```


### excise

```
Given `json` and a JSONPath string `paths`, return the JSON value with
the elements at the location removed.
   
The following `opts-map` are supported:
    :prune-empty?  Removes empty maps and vectors, as well as
                   key-value pairs where values are empty, after the
                   elements are excised. Default false.
```

``` clojure
(= (dissoc stmt "id")
   (excise stmt "$.id"))
```


### apply-values

```
Given `json`, a JSONPath string `paths`, and the JSON data
`value`, apply `value` to the location given by `paths` If
the location exists, update the pre-existing value. Otherwise,
create the necessary data structures needed to contain `value`.

The following caveats apply:
- If an array index skips over any vector entries, those skipped
    entries will be assigned nil.
- If a path contains a wildcard and the location up to that
    point does not exist, create a new vector.
- If a path contains a wildcard and the location is a collection,
    append it to the coll. In the case of maps, the key is its
    current size, e.g. {\"2\" : \"foo\"}.
- Recursive descent, array slicing, and negative array indices
    are disallowed (as per strict mode).

`apply-value` does not take an options map as an argument.
```

``` clojure
(= (update-in
    stmt
    ["context" "contextActivities" "category"]
    (fn [old] (conj old
                    {"id" "http://www.example.com/meetings/categories/brainstorm_sesh"})))
   (apply-value stmt
                "$.context.contextActivities.category[*].id"
                "http://www.example.com/meetings/categories/brainstorm_sesh"))
```

### path-spec/path->spec

```
Given a root spec and a parsed path into it, return the spec for
that path, or nil if it is not possible. Accepts optional hint
data (i.e. an xAPI Statement) to dispatch multi-specs
```

Unlike the previous API functions, this function is designed specifically for xAPI Statements.

```clojure
(path->spec ::xapi-schema/activity
            ["definition" "name" "en-US"])
=> ::xapi-schema/language-map-text


(path->spec ::xapi-schema/statement
            ["object" "definition" "correctResponsesPattern" 0])
=> string?
